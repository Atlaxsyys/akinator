# AKINATOR :computer:
## Project Description :writing_hand:
Akinator Game is a console implementation of the classic Akinator game in the C language. The program uses a binary tree to guess objects by asking questions with "yes" or "no" answers. If the program cannot guess the object, the user can add a new object and a question that distinguishes it. The project supports saving and loading the database, visualizing the tree using Graphviz, as well as logging for debugging.

The program was written on a WSL, but it is easily portable to Windows.

### Main features :boom:
- **The Akinator Game**: The program asks questions to guess the object that the user has guessed.
- **Adding new objects**: If the object is not guessed, the user can add it to the database by specifying a new question and answer.
- **Object Comparison**: The ability to compare two objects, showing their common and unique characteristics.
- **Visualization of the tree**: Generating a graphical representation of a decision tree using Graphviz.
- **Saving the database**: Saving the current state of the tree to a file when exiting.
- **Logging**: Detailed event logging (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR levels)

## How to play? :video_game:
when you start the program, a menu will appear in the console:
![example](image_for_readme/menu.png)
- If you choose 1, the guessing game will start, but if Akinator couldn't guess what you guessed, you can add this element with a distinctive characteristic. If akinator guessed your word, he will output it to the console: I guessed right.
example of a game:
![example game](image_for_readme/play.png)
- If you choose 2, a visualization of the tree will appear on the screen.
- If you choose 3, you must enter the object from the database, and its characteristics will be displayed in the console.
example of a definition:
![example definition](image_for_readme/definiton.png)
- If you choose 4, you must enter two objects from the database, and the common and unique characteristics of the objects will be displayed in the console.
example of comparing elements:
![example comparing_nodes](image_for_readme/comparing_nodes.png)
- If you choose 5, The program will end with the new objects saved, if you have added them.
- If you choose 6, The program will end without saving new objects.

## DATABASE :dizzy:
- database example:
```
small?
    mouse
    poltorashka
```
- Should questions end with a symbol `?`
- Should the answers (leaves of the tree) not contain `?`
- Indentation (spaces or tabs) defines the structure of the tree.

Using Graphviz tree, the visualization of the tree looks like this:

## Building and running :building_construction:
if you do not have graphviz installed and you are running on linux or wsl, then type in the console:
```
sudo apt install graphviz
```
to compile the program, type in the console:
```
make build
```
to run the program, type in the console:
```
make run
```
