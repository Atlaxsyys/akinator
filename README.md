#AKINATOR
##Project Description
Akinator Game is a console implementation of the classic Akinator game in the C language. The program uses a binary tree to guess objects by asking questions with "yes" or "no" answers. If the program cannot guess the object, the user can add a new object and a question that distinguishes it. The project supports saving and loading the database, visualizing the tree using Graphviz, as well as logging for debugging.
