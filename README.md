# AKINATOR
## Project Description
Akinator Game is a console implementation of the classic Akinator game in the C language. The program uses a binary tree to guess objects by asking questions with "yes" or "no" answers. If the program cannot guess the object, the user can add a new object and a question that distinguishes it. The project supports saving and loading the database, visualizing the tree using Graphviz, as well as logging for debugging.

### Main features
**The Akinator Game**: The program asks questions to guess the object that the user has guessed.
**Adding new objects**: If the object is not guessed, the user can add it to the database by specifying a new question and answer.
**Object Comparison**: The ability to compare two objects, showing their common and unique characteristics.
**Visualization of the tree**: Generating a graphical representation of a decision tree using Graphviz.
**Saving the database**: Saving the current state of the tree to a file when exiting.
